# FS2025modding

Functionality:

The mod does this to every field:
- Chooses a random chemical element (out of 12 total) and assigns it to the field
- Generates a random amount of said element that the field needs
- Repeats this after every harvest

A player can:
- Using the SmartAgrometer tool scan any field he wants to know the info of (plants need to be growing there)
- Buy a specific kind of fertilizer which the field needs 
- If fertilized correctly, the yield increases by x%
